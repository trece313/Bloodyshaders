## Compatibility
- The Bloody Shaders are compatible with both **OptiFine** and **Iris**. Ensure you have one of these shader-compatible mods installed to use the shaders properly.

## Note
Make sure you have a compatible version of Minecraft and either OptiFine or Iris installed, as shaders require these to work properly.
